# List of Indicators (Total: ~277)

The "Total Indicators: 277" statistic on the Home page is derived from two sources:

1. **211 Curated Indicators** (from `curated_indicators.csv`)
2. **66 Live API Indicators** (fetched from World Bank API)

**Note:** There is overlap between these two sets (e.g., GDP, GINI, Unemployment). The system counts them separately as they come from different sources (Static Dataset vs. Live API).
